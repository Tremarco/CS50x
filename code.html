        <h1 class="mainTitle">Code</h1>
            <p class="text">I began my coding journey in 2022, after deciding that I no longer wished to continue teaching English abroad forever. After a bit of "new-career" googling, I elected to teach myself to code.
                I originally began with a Python course on Udemy. Despite learning plenty of syntax and fundamentals, I felt that I hadn't yet learned to "think" like a developer and was unable to solve problems independently.
                After some further research, I signed up for Harvard's 'CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science'. This website was created during that course's week 8 problem set, "Homepage".
                Thus far in my journey I have worked with various programming languages, query languages and markup languages, including C, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS and SQL.
                Below is a link to my Github:</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/Tremarco" target="new" id="githubicon"><i class="bi bi-github"></i></a>
            <p class="text">You'll find my repository for my CS50x submissions, as well as my solutions for the Advent of Code Challenge 2022. This was something I attempted as a bit of fun, and to practice my Python syntax
                whilst I was still dealing with C during the earlier weeks of CS50. Eventually, the problems became difficult enough that I found myself spending more time on AOCC than I was on CS50x, so there are only solutions
                for the first 6 days. After this time I refocused my efforts on to CS50; I plan to attempt the 2023 version of the challenge when that rolls around, and use it as a way to gauge my development over the year.
                Once I finish CS50x, I plan to study for and take the AWS cloud engineer certifications (at the advice of various friends and family members working in the field) as well as one or two additional CS50 courses;
                perhaps CS50p and CS50 web. My ultimate goal is to get a full time job in the industry at some point over the next 12-24 months.
