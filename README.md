# CS50x
My submissions for labs and problem sets completed for Harvard University's CS50x introduction to computer science course. 
The course takes a language agnostic approach, instead focusing on fundamentals and good coding habits, as well as "how to think like a developer". As such, the languages used in this repository are quite diverse, including C, Python, SQL, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
