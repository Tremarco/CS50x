                    <p class="text">Intricate world building meets fast paced page turner. A little slow to find its feet, perhaps, but once it does it never lets go.
                        'Priory' follows that path most taken in epic-fantasy; "disparate factions overcome differences to unite in the face of mythological ancient evil." Yet thanks to Shannon's well fleshed out
                        characters, inhabiting a world that feels discovered rather than created, it manages to feel fresh and interesting nonetheless. A unique take on the 'mage' archetype and some interesting
                        dualities in the opposing forms of dragon (western "fire breathers" versus eastern "water god dragons") set up interesting fight sequences whilst also providing a fertile backdrop
                        for plenty of interesting thematic exposition. Very good, would recommend!

                    <p class="text">The 7th installment in Brandon Sanderson's 'Mistborn' series, and the final chapter of the era 2 'Wax and Wayne' saga, this one has been long anticipated by Cosmere fans.
                        'The Lost Metal' does not disappoint, and is an absolute home run of a book. Sanderson has long been one of the most (if not THE most) accomplished writers in the world thanks to his
                        totally unique and fascinating magic systems. It feels like many authors have made entire careers out of one magic system far less developed (and far less cool) than any one of Sanderson's, and yet
                        he just continually churns out new ones at a frightening pace. 'Lost Metal' in particular showcases these talents as it features many crossovers from other worlds in the Cosmere, making for some really
                        satisfying cameos from other fan favourite magic systems, alongside some totally new (and totally sweet) ones. Adding to this, Sanderson has now added to that an increased depth of character writing (Wanye is the GOAT) that was arguably somewhat lacking in his
                        earlier installments. Shallan versus Sterris is a great example of how he struggled somewhat to write these kinds of characters in a "non-grating" way previously, but has certainly rectified that now.
                        Any fan of fantasy that has not picked up a Sanderson book should do so immediately; any pre-existing Sanderson fans have already finished this book and need not be told. 5/5, an absolute gem. </p>

                    <p class="text">R.F.Kuang's "The Poppy War" is heavily influenced by 20th century China. The "century of shame", the rape of Nanjing and the opium crisis form the core of the world and book she has created.
                        For me, it leans on historical allegory a little too much to be considered truly great, but that doesn't take away from what is a fun story and a worthwhile read. It deals with the dark horrors of this
                        period very well, and whilst ostensibly increadibly biased (pseudo china=good pseudo japan=evil) this gives way to more nuanced discussions about the ability of any human anywhere to commit unspeakable
                        acts in the name of a "just" cause. 3.5/5, a good read, if a little predictable for those with even a basic knowledge of this period in Chinese history.

                <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem" target="new"><div>The Three Body Problem</div></a>
                    <div class="stars"><i class="bi bi-star-fill"></i><i class="bi bi-star-fill"></i><i class="bi bi-star-fill"></i><i class="bi bi-star"></i><i class="bi bi-star"></i></div>
                    <p class="text">The Three Body Problem is a book I'd heard so much about and had been meaning to get around to reading for literally years. Given the high public praise and the long built up anticipation,
                        the book itself was something of a disappointment. The theoretical physics framework of the book is fascinating, and the book deals well with some pretty cool thematic ideas regarding the human condition,
                        slash and burn capitalism, and the effect that the discovery of any kind of alien life being confirmed could have upon society. Despite all of this, the prose of the book is so poor as to be almost unreadable at times. I'm not sure if this
                        is an issue with the translation from the original Mandarin to English, or if the problems are in the actual original text themselves. Thanks to my years living in China, I do understand Mandarin to some extent
                        (though reading the entire novel in Mandarin is somewhat beyond my current level) and so can recognise certain instances where the patterns of speech are weird in English, but result from directly translating Chinese
                        phrases into English. It doesn't really work, and would benefit from "interpretation" rather than pure "translation". Either way, the result is an English version full of clunky, childish dialogue
                        and 2 dimensional characters that seem to have an astonishing dearth of real emotions. Without getting in to spoilers, it's almost impossible to feel any kind of empathy for any of the characters in this book. It could
                        be argued that this is somewhat the point (humans repeatedly showing they are undeserving of our place in the universe is a recurring theme), but I can't help but feel it could have been achieved with slightly higher grade writing.
                        An enjoyable concept with some novel ideas, let down by the writing itself. 3/5, worth reading but don't believe the hype!
